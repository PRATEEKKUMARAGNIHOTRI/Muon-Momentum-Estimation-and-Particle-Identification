# Muon-Momentum-Estimation-and-Particle-Identification
Muon momentum estimation using GNNs and other deep learning variants

## Dataset for Task 1 and 2
The first two tasks use Monte-Carlo simulated data from the Cathode Strip Chambers (CSC) at the CMS experiment.
These chambers detect muon particles in the outer layer of the CMS detector, allowing us to store information about the hit locations.
